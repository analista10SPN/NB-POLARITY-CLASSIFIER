<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement:</h3>
<p>In the wake of the Haitian crisis of 2024, the international community has witnessed an inundation of news coverage, spanning a wide array of media outlets each with its unique editorial stance. This deluge of information, while instrumental in raising awareness, presents a significant challenge: the inherent political bias embedded within these articles. Such biases can subtly or overtly influence the narratives presented, leading to a skewed perception of the crisis among the global audience. Given the potential of these biases to shape public opinion and, by extension, international response and policy-making, there is a pressing need for a systematic approach to dissect and understand these underlying biases.</p>
<p>The challenge, therefore, lies not only in identifying the political leanings embedded within the vast sea of news articles but also in quantifying the degree to which these biases may tilt the narrative in favor of one ideological perspective over another. This nuanced understanding of bias is crucial, as the portrayal of international crises through a biased lens can significantly impact humanitarian support, diplomatic relations, and policy decisions at both the national and international levels. The absence of a methodical framework to analyze and categorize these biases hampers the ability of policymakers, scholars, and the general public to form a balanced and informed understanding of the crisis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the implications of biased reporting extend beyond the immediate crisis, affecting long-term perceptions of nations, their people, and the international community’s role in conflict resolution. Therefore, the development and implementation of a Naïve Bayes classification system to systematically analyze and categorize the political biases in news coverage of the Haitian crisis represent a critical step towards enhancing media literacy, promoting informed public discourse, and contributing to the academic discourse on media bias in the context of international crises. This research aims to fill this gap, providing tools and insights that can lead to a more equitable and balanced consumption of news media.</p>
<h3 id="objectives">Objectives:</h3>
<ul>
<li>To develop a Naïve Bayes classifier capable of distinguishing between left-leaning and right-leaning biases in news reporting on the Haitian crisis.</li>
<li>To analyze the distribution of political biases in news coverage and assess how these biases may impact readers’ understanding of the crisis.</li>
<li>To contribute to the broader discourse on media bias in international news reporting, using the Haitian crisis of 2024 as a case study.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="significance">Significance:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced Media Literacy</strong>: Helping readers recognize biases in news reporting, fostering critical consumption of media.</li>
<li><strong>Informed Public Discourse</strong>: Providing insights into how biases might color the narrative of international crises, contributing to more informed public discussions.</li>
<li><strong>Academic Contribution</strong>: Filling a gap in the literature on media bias analysis in the context of international crises, particularly through the application of machine learning techniques like Naïve Bayes classification.</li>
